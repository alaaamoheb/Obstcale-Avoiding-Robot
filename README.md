# Obstcale-Avoiding-Robot
Building an Obstacle-Avoiding Robot.
The Project is implemented in embedded C using the AVR Atmega328P microcontroller, Ultrasonic sensor, and L298N Motor Driver. The robot is designed to navigate autonomously and avoid obstacles in its path using a combination of sensors and control algorithms.



# Features

* Autonomous obstacle avoidance: The robot uses an Ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles in its path and employs control algorithms to avoid them.
* Motor control: The code controls the direction and speed of the robot's movement using the L298N Motor Driver.
* Sensor integration: The Ultrasonic sensor is utilized to perceive the environment and detect obstacles.
* Embedded C Language: The code is written in Embedded C
